How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Writing technically sound code is essential in developing modern business applications. JUnit is a testing platform which allows you to add tests over time, allowing for the development of rigorous testing platforms for businesses over time. These tests can be applied to a number of modules, which I was able to do for multiple object types within this project.

While developing technically sound code is important, itâ€™s also important to recognize that as these tests become more and more rigorous, the resources used by the tests increases. Thus, writing efficient code is also very important when writing scalable applications. I ensured that these tests were efficient by minimizing the complexity of the tests I ran. Thankfully, this application mostly relied on simple input validation, and more complex tests were not necessary.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is an important step in developing a program that meets the needs of its users. In order to effectively gather user requirements, it's important to follow a rigorous process of conducting user research through things like interviews, user surveys and team discussions in order to best ascertain what features will be most useful for users. This also helps to prioritize requirements based on their emphasis during these discussions. Acceptance testing is another crucial step of integrating user requirements into a piece of software. Things like alpha/beta testing of new features can help developers gain a clearer understanding of how well the users' needs are being addressed by the software they are developing. One of the most important aspects of ensuring user requirements are met is continuous feedback from users. This applies both during software development, and once a product is released. Gaining feedback after a product's release is critical, as continuous integration allows for the development of new features, and addition of these features to software to meet evolving user needs.

How do I approach designing software?

The most important part of software design is the careful consideration of user requirements. Once these requirements are gathered, the design of software should mostly be centered around the user experience. The user should have an experience that is the most in line with their requirements possible while ensuring software security.
